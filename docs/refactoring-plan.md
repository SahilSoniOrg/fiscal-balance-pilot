# Financial Application Refactoring Plan

## Overview

This document outlines our plan to refactor the current codebase to reduce duplication, improve maintainability, and enhance the developer experience. We'll track progress and update this document as we implement improvements.

## Current Issues

### 1. API Data Fetching Duplication
- Similar fetch-state-error patterns in `AccountsList`, `AccountDetail`, `JournalsList`
- Repeated loading/error UI code in multiple components
- Redundant pagination implementation for journals and account transactions
- Inconsistent error handling and state management

### 2. Form Handling Redundancy
- Similar validation logic in `AccountDialog` and `JournalEntryDialog`
- Duplicate input change handlers and state management
- Form submission patterns repeated across components
- Error handling duplicated in forms

### 3. UI Component Complexity
- Large components with 200+ lines of code
- Components handling too many responsibilities (UI, data fetching, state management)
- Inconsistent styling approaches
- Modal dialogs with repeated code patterns

### 4. Error Handling Inconsistencies
- `ErrorBoundary` component present but inconsistently applied
- Different approaches to displaying errors and fallbacks
- Duplicate error state management
- Inconsistent error messages and displays

### 5. Context Usage Issues
- Mixture of context-based and direct API fetching
- Inconsistent data flow patterns
- Unclear responsibilities between context providers and components
- Redundant state management

## Improvement Plan

### 1. Create Custom Hooks for Common Operations

| Hook | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `useApiResource<T>` | Reusable hook for fetching data with loading/error states | âœ… Completed |
| `usePaginatedData<T>` | Token-based pagination hook with consistent interfaces | âœ… Completed |
| `useFormState<T>` | Form state management with validation | âœ… Completed |
| `useDialogState` | Manage dialog open/close state with consistent patterns | âœ… Completed |

### 2. Extract Reusable UI Components

| Component | Purpose | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| `LoadingState` | Consistent loading indicator | âœ… Completed |
| `ErrorDisplay` | Standardized error display | âœ… Completed |
| `EmptyState` | Reusable empty data state | âœ… Completed |
| `PaginationControls` | Reusable pagination UI | âœ… Completed |
| `ResourceListItem` | Base component for list items | âœ… Completed |
| `ResourceHeader` | Standardized resource header with actions | âœ… Completed |

### 3. Form Component Refactoring

| Component/Feature | Purpose | Status |
|-------------------|---------|--------|
| `FormField` | Base component for form fields with validation | âœ… Completed |
| `FormSelect` | Standardized select component with error handling | âœ… Completed |
| Field validation | Reusable validation functions | âœ… Completed |
| Form submission | Standardized submission handling | âœ… Completed |

### 4. Dialog Component Standardization

| Component | Purpose | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| `EntityDialog<T>` | Base component for CRUD dialogs | âœ… Completed |
| Dialog layouts | Consistent dialog layouts and styling | âœ… Completed |
| Dialog actions | Standardized action buttons and behavior | âœ… Completed |

### 5. API Service Enhancement

| Feature | Purpose | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `AccountService` | Account-specific API methods | âœ… Completed |
| `JournalService` | Journal-specific API methods | âœ… Completed |
| Response handling | Standardized response handling | âœ… Completed |
| Request caching | Improve performance with caching | ðŸ”„ Not Started |

### 6. State Management Improvements

| Feature | Purpose | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Context refinement | Improve context implementations | ðŸ”„ Not Started |
| Optimistic updates | Better UX with optimistic state updates | ðŸ”„ Not Started |
| State synchronization | Ensure components stay in sync | ðŸ”„ Not Started |

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Extraction and Cleanup (Current)
- Extract common utility functions and hooks
- Create reusable UI components
- Document patterns for team consistency

### Phase 2: Component Refactoring
- Refactor one component at a time, starting with the most duplicated patterns
- Implement and test new hooks on individual components
- Update tests to reflect new component structure

### Phase 3: Global State Refinement
- Improve context implementations
- Standardize API interactions
- Implement proper caching and state synchronization

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization
- Add memoization where appropriate
- Implement virtualization for large lists
- Optimize render performance

## Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Component Size**: Keep components under 200 lines of code
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each component should do one thing well
3. **DRY Principle**: Use hooks and utility functions to avoid repetition
4. **Consistent Error Handling**: Use ErrorBoundary and standard error UI
5. **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript interfaces for all props and state
6. **Testing**: Add tests for all new components and hooks
